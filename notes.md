The start of my notes. I'm keeping my primary class notes in a program I love called "obsidian" which is free and does internal links. It also uses markdown but it visually displays it in real time too. So I will continue to write everything in there, and then just directly copy and paste stuff into here that seems most helpful for later (specifically for the final.)

Learned about deploying Caddy files to get simon onto my server.
```
./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
```
